WILLIAM: I'm going to migrate this project to github, since everybody working on it prefers git anyways: https://github.com/williamstein/psage



The target audience of [PSAGE](http://purple.sagemath.org) is research mathematicians, with an emphasis on arithmetic geometry.   PSAGE is closely related to [Sage](http://sagemath.org).

See the page [for help on getting started](http://code.google.com/p/purplesage/wiki/GettingStarted).

The psage Python library includes bits and pieces of new-ish code relevant to the following problems:

  * Computing p-adic L-series of some modular abelian varieties of dimension > 1 (Jen Balakrishnan and William Stein)
  * Computing Hilbert modular forms over Q(sqrt(5))   (William Stein and Aly Deines).
  * Maass forms (from Fredrick Stromberg)
  * Siegel modular forms (from Skorupa, Nathan Ryan, etc.)
  * Computation of images of elliptic curve Galois representations (Drew Sutherland)
  * Computation of L-series of elliptic curves over functions fields (Sal Baig and Chris Hall)
  * Modular forms fourier expansion framework (Martin Raum, a student of Zagier)
